# GPT Minimal API

This project is a study of the GPT-2 model, created to explore building a minimal API for text generation using Python, FastAPI, and Docker. It serves as a simple starting point for those who want to better understand how to use language models in a containerized environment.

## Overview

The API allows you to send a text prompt and receive a continuation generated by the GPT-2 model. It’s a lightweight implementation, easy to set up, and ideal for experimentation and learning about using GPT-2.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Python 3.10+
